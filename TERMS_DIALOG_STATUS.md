## ⚠️ TERMS & CONDITIONS DIALOG ISSUE:

I attempted to add the full Terms & Conditions content you requested, but the file editing tools kept corrupting the Projects.tsx file due to its large size (800+ lines).

### **Current State:**
- ✅ Working simple terms dialog (2 checkboxes)  
- ✅ Button disabled until both checkboxes checked
- ❌ Missing full Terms content
- ❌ Missing "Show More/Show Less" toggles

### **The Full Content You Want:**
You showed me the screenshot with:
- Full "Terms and Conditions" text (with sections 1, 2, 3)  
- Full "Privacy Policy" text (with sections 1, 2, 3)
- "Read More" / "Show Less" toggle buttons
- Two checkboxes that must be checked

## 🔧 SOLUTION OPTIONS:

### **Option 1 (Recommended): Manual Update**

I'll provide you the EXACT code for the Terms Dialog section, and you can:
1. Open `Pages/Projects.tsx` in your code editor
2. Find the Terms Dialog section (around line 514+)
3. Replace it with the correct content I provide
4. Save

**Time:** 2-3 minutes  
**Risk:** Very low (you're in control)

### **Option 2: Use the Current Simple Dialog**

The current dialog works perfectly:
- ✅ Validates acceptance
- ✅ Button disabled until both checked
- ✅ Investment flow works

You can add the full terms later when needed!

### **Option 3: I Try Again with Smaller Edits**

I can make very targeted edits line-by-line, but given the file corruption issues, this might not work reliably.
